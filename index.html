					<article class="col-md-4">
						<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/3zZIF">Keuka Lake</a></h4>
						<p>One of the jewels of the Finger Lakes. You can not go wrong in choosing this body of water. Keuka offers both good Small
						Mouth and Large Mouth bass fishing. The fishing picks up in late spring and remains good throughout the summer months
						and into the fall. This Lake, also, offers live bait fishing for Small Mouths in the summer months. A huge plus when
						inexperienced anglers or children are involved.</p>
					</article>
				 <article class="col-md-4">
						<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/MusJl">Seneca Lake</a></h4>
						<p>The deepest of the Finger Lakes. Seneca is a large lake that runs from Watkins Glen to Geneva. It does not have the
						numbers of Small Mouth that Keuka has, but the fish are bigger. Here the average fish weighs around 3 to 4 pounds with
						occasional 5 pound fish caught.</p>
					</article>
					<article class="col-md-4">
						<h4><a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/du9Ur">Cayuga Lake</a></h4>
						<p>Cayuga Lake is the longest of the Finger Lakes and offers good bass fishing as well as a tremendous Lake trout
						population.</p>

						<p>The Small Mouth numbers in Cayuga are not great, but the fish are big!
						Largemouth Bass fishing in Cayuga is quite good, especially in the northern 3rd of the lake, from June-September.</p>

						<p>Cayuga Lake is the best lake trout lake in all of the Finger Lakes. They are the main cold-water fish caught in Cayuga
						Lake and their size is impressive. They average around 5 to 8 pounds with many bigger fish caught as well. I jig fish
						for them with rod and real and do not troll. Rainbow and brown trout are considered a by-catch as I do not target them,
						but the are often hooked as well.</p>
